# ADLIN Test

This is a technical test for the ADLIN company. The goal of the test is to create a simple web application to book meeting rooms.

## Notes and thoughts

I've used Vuetify for the UI components to get a chance to play with version 3 a bit and to gain time on the UI.
I've added IDs to the items in the list of rooms to be able to identify them in a more reliable way.
I also would have liked to setup a proper lint configuration with Git Hooks, to configure a proper logger and so on!

## Front-End

### Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur).

### Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

### Customize configuration
